📝 FAQ 📝

If I could use only one statement to review the overall health of a company, which statement would I use, and why?

Answer; The statement of cash flows gives a true picture of how much cash the company is generating. Ironically, it often gets the least attention. You can probably pick a different answer for this question, but you need to provide a good justification (e.g., the balance sheet because assets are the true driver of cash flow; or the income statement because it shows the earning power and profitability of a company on a smoothed out accrual basis).

If it were up to you, what would our company’s budgeting process look like?

Answer; This is somewhat subjective. A good budget is one that has buy-in from all departments in the company, is realistic yet strives for achievement, has been risk-adjusted to allow for a margin of error, and is tied to the company’s overall strategic plan.

How are the three main financial statements connected?

Answer; The three main financial statements are balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Net income links to both the balance sheet and the income statement, with net income flowing into the stockholder’s equity via retained earnings on this period’s balance sheet. After all of these are linked, the sum of the cash is added to the previous period’s ending balance.
